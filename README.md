## Interface and Interaction
#### Task Input: 
Users can type tasks into an input field and add them to the list by clicking a button or pressing enter.
#### Task Display: 
Tasks are displayed in a list format for easy viewing, often with options to mark them as done, edit, or delete them.

## Functionalities
#### Adding a Task
###### User Input: 
Users enter a task into the input field.
###### Validation: 
The application checks that the input is not empty.
###### Storage: 
The task is added to the list (stored temporarily in memory and optionally saved persistently in a file or database).
Display Update: The task appears in the task list on the interface.

#### Deleting a Task
###### Selection: 
Users select a task from the list.
###### Action: 
A "Delete" button removes the selected task.
###### Storage Update: 
The task is removed from the list in memory and from the persistent storage.
###### Display Update: 
The task disappears from the interface.

#### Marking a Task as Completed
###### Selection: 
Users select a task to mark it as done (usually by clicking a checkbox or toggling a button).
###### Visual Feedback: 
The task might change appearance (e.g., strikethrough text) to indicate completion.
###### Optional Storage: 
The task's completion status is updated in persistent storage.


#### Persistent Storage
To ensure tasks are not lost when the application is closed, a To-Do List app often uses a storage mechanism:

###### Text File: Tasks are saved in a simple file like tasks.txt. Each task is written as a line of text.
JSON/CSV Files: Tasks and their metadata (e.g., completion status, deadlines) are saved in a structured format.
Database: For more advanced applications, tasks are stored in a database like SQLite or Firebase for scalability and cloud synchronization.
#### Updating the List
Whenever tasks are added, deleted, or modified:

The application updates the internal task list (stored in memory).
The display is refreshed to reflect the changes.
Persistent storage is updated to save the current state of the task list.
#### Enhancements and Advanced Features
Categories and Tags
Users can organize tasks into groups, such as "Work," "Personal," or "Shopping," or add tags for filtering.

###### Reminders and Notifications
Tasks with deadlines can send reminders to ensure timely completion.

###### Synchronization
Tasks are synced across devices via cloud services, allowing users to access their lists anywhere.

##### How It‚Äôs Built
###### Frontend
Built using GUI libraries like Tkinter (Python), React (JavaScript), or native mobile frameworks.
Displays input fields, task lists, buttons, and visual elements.
###### Backend
Manages task addition, deletion, and updates.
Handles storage and retrieval of tasks from files or databases.
